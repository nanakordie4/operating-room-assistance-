# Evaluating Edge & Cloud Computing in the Operating Room

This experiment explores the tradeoff between Edge and Cloud computing for real-time assitance in the operating room.
It should take 2-3 hours to run this experiement.

You can run this experiemnt on the [Chameleon](https://chameleoncloud.org/) testbed. To run this experiment you should already have an account on Chameleon, be part of a project, and have configured keys om CHI@Edge, CHI@UC, and KVM@TACC.

## Background

### Future of Agriculutral

### Edge vs Cloud

### Methodology

## Results

## Run my experiment

### Set up resources at CHI@Edge
first least for raspi4
set up server
insteall ml
### Measure inference time at CHI@Edge
how to copy models to chi@edge provide test images etc
add folder, name it edge, in folder put basic tflite model edgetpu, text.txt, test images
### Set up resources at CHI@UC
first lease for rtx6000gpu
set up server
install machine learning
### Measure inference time at CHI@UC
how to copy models to chi@edge provide test images etc
add folder, name it edge, in folder put h5 model, text.txt, test images
### Set up resources at KVM@TACC
set up stuff
### Measure network transfer times at KVM@TACC
set it up how it is on my computer
